        <p> Art and painting or doing arts and crafts was always a activity that was fun and made me feel happy at home or even outside! When ever I had free time or when I came from school I would not watch TV, but I would take out a arts or craft like stiching, painting, using my imagining mind to make whatever I thought of and I was in my own world of creating at the time. Also I really like how I can show people how I feel with my artwork! </p>
